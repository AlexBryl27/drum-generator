# music generator

Generate midi track with different models: 
* RNN with attention
* VAE
* Markov chain
* GAN (not implemented yet)

Guitarpro files are used as input data, from which the track is parsed by name. Originally planned to generate only drums, but the project has expanded a lot. 

The output is generated to a midi file
